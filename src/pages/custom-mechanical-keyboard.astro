      <h1>Building Titan Made</h1>
      <h2 class="block text-black dark:text-white">My Journey From Side Project to Selling Custom Keyboards</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        Looking back, building Titan Made is one of the biggest accomplishments of my
        life. What started as a small side project during 60-hour work weeks as a
        carpenter turned into a full-fledged business. From designing my own custom
        keyboard to selling over $25,000 worth of products on Amazon and Kickstarter,
        the experience completely changed my view of the world and what I wanted out
        of life. In fact, it was the reason I decided to come back to school.
      </p>

      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        In 2022, I started working on the Titan Made keyboard as a way to challenge
        myself and create something I couldn’t find on the market. After long days on
        construction sites, I’d spend my evenings sketching designs in AutoCAD. Once
        the layout came together, I moved on to building a 3D model of the case in
        Autodesk Inventor.
      </p>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        That was just the start. To make the keyboard functional, I had to design a
        PCB—a completely new skill for me at the time. I spent months learning how to
        use Eagle, watching YouTube tutorials, and studying online documentation.
        Around the same time, I started learning Arduino programming to get the
        hardware to communicate. After countless late nights troubleshooting, I
        finally had a working prototype.
      </p>

      <h2>The Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        By mid-2023, I decided to take the project to Kickstarter. The goal was to
        raise $20,000 to produce 70 keyboards, and to my surprise, the campaign hit
        its target. That success felt like a major milestone, but it also came with a
        steep learning curve.
      </p>
      <h2>Selling on Amazon and Expanding</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        The manufacturing process was incredibly demanding. From sourcing hundreds of
        PCB components to coordinating CNC machining for the cases and designing
        custom packaging, every step required careful planning. I’d spend breaks at
        work calling manufacturers, trying to negotiate prices and keep the project
        on track. To make the keyboard visually appealing before it even existed, I
        used tools like Photoshop to create renders from STEP files. Balancing all of
        this while working full-time wasn’t easy, but I was determined to see it
        through.

      </p>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        Once the Kickstarter orders were fulfilled, I expanded to Shopify and Amazon,
        where I sold the keyboards alongside smaller items like mouse mats. Over
        time, sales exceeded $25,000. I even reached out to larger influencers and
        companies, like Night.co, to explore potential collaborations. While none of
        those deals closed, the experience of pitching to established teams was
        invaluable.

      <h2>Lessons Learned and a New Direction</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        Titan Made taught me so much more than just technical skills. It showed me
        what’s possible when you push yourself outside of your comfort zone. One of
        the biggest lessons was learning how to focus. I tried to pack too many
        features into the keyboard, which made the design more complex than it needed
        to be. Simplicity is something I’ll prioritize in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        The project also made me reflect on my career and what I wanted out of life.
        Working as a carpenter was stable, but it didn’t feel fulfilling in the same
        way that designing and building the keyboard did. Titan Made made me realize
        how much I enjoy solving complex problems and creating something new, which
        ultimately inspired me to go back to school to study math and computer
        science.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        While Titan Made is no longer in business after a failed second project, it
        remains one of the defining achievements of my life. Taking an idea from a
        sketch to a fully functional product, selling it to real customers, and
        learning so much along the way completely changed my perspective on what I’m
        capable of.
      </p>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        This project wasn’t just about building a keyboard—it was about discovering a
        passion for learning and creating, and it’s something I’ll carry with me into
        everything I do moving forward.
