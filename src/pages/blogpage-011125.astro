      <h1>Finance Tracker Website</h1>
      <h2 class="block text-black dark:text-white">January 11, 2025</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">After starting this finance tracker app 4-5 months ago, I’m finally done! School got in the way for a while, but I spent this past week focusing on it and was able to wrap everything up. It feels good to have a finished product that works the way I envisioned, and it’s been a great way to apply some of the skills I’ve been learning. You can check it out <a href="financeflowtech.com/home">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">The app helps users track their spending, set budgets, and see where their money is going. I wanted it to be more than just a basic expense tracker, so I integrated the Plaid API to let users securely connect their bank accounts. This makes it much easier to import transactions automatically instead of having to enter everything manually. I also added charts and graphs to help visualize spending trends because, let’s be real, data is always better when you can actually see it.</p>

      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">
        I originally planned to work on this app with a group of people but everyone that said they wanted to work on it backed out so maybe that is a lesson for the future. Initially I had some trouble getting the Plaid API set up, but it taught me a lot about connecting the front end and back end and working with Django to manage everything. Balancing the project with school made things tricky. Between assignments and exams, I didn’t have much time to work on it for months. This week, I finally had the chance to focus on it, and I’m really happy to have it finished now.</p>
