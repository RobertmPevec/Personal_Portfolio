      <h1>2025 Programming Goals</h1>
      <h2 class="block text-black dark:text-white">January 1, 2025</h2>
      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">Over the winter break, I decided to try something new and started Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization. I didn’t expect it to become such an eye-opening experience, but it’s been a great introduction to machine learning and how it applies to the things I’m already learning in my math and computer science degree.</p>

      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">To be honest, I’ve never been that interested in going to grad school. I always thought I’d focus on getting experience through work instead of more education. But working through this specialization made me think differently. I’ve realized there’s so much more to machine learning than I thought, and a master’s might actually be worth considering if it helps me dive deeper into the field.</p>

      <p class="block text-sm font-medium text-black dark:text-white">Going forward, I want to shift my focus away from web development and spend more time diving into machine learning. This winter break has shown me how much I enjoy working on projects that combine math and programming in such meaningful ways. Another big goal for 2025 is landing a co-op job for the spring term, ideally in a role where I can apply what I’m learning about machine learning and gain real-world experience. I’m excited to keep building on this foundation and see where it takes me.</p>
